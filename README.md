# String Reversal in C++

## Description
This program reads a string input from the user and outputs the reversed string. It demonstrates basic string manipulation and iteration in C++.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter a string.
- It reads the input string using the `getline` function to capture the entire line, including spaces.
- The program then iterates over the string in reverse order and constructs the reversed string.
- Finally, it prints the reversed string to the console.
